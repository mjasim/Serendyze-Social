Only complaint is they have a clasp that is used to keep them together when folded, that makes them slightly irritating as it hits your ear when used for long periods. Bottom line is, for $35, these are by far superior to anything out there.",

As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image. Overall I think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review. They've also been surprisingly durable.",

Good bass and not overwhelming. The design is a little outdated but I grew up in the 80's so it is fine with me. In fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Amazon Instant Video. Good bang for your buck and definitely a true value.",

Yeah, it clearly cant compete with a $300+ set, but its easy to brush off and still get into the music.  My only complaint is that the cable feels fragile.  Everything else feels right.",

I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.  Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now.  It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT.  Not sure what to replace them with.",

The ear piece can snap back in place but then fall out within a minute. HORRIBLE! The sound is pretty good for the price point, but definitely as good as the sennheiser px100 that some guy wrote about. I had those headphones and the are far the best sub $80 headphones I have ever used. I'm going to be ordering those on Cyber Monday. I returned these cheap pieces of crap.",

An obvious improvement over the included Ipod headphones.  For the price, pretty much an easy choice.  They are comfortable to wear, only limitation is that they offer some, but not much, isolation from external noise.",

Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.",

The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.",

They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.",

Only complaint is they have a clasp that is used to keep them together when folded, that makes them slightly irritating as it hits your ear when used for long periods. Bottom line is, for $35, these are by far superior to anything out there.", "Not bad but doesn't really block noise at all. Ear buds don't sit comfortably in my ears, so I finally bought actual headphones. These headphones have good sound quality, but they don't really rest on my head comfortably and eventually one of my ears starts to hurt because it is carrying top much of the load. For the money I would have liked more comfort and better physical noise blocking.", "good product. After ~ a month of use,  I'm well pleased with the porta pro.  Sound quality is all I could ask with strong bass and wonderful clarity and presence.  I have a large head, and the headband adjustment is just adequate, and the phones do need adjustment to remain comfortable after an hour or so.  The unit appears to be of high quality and folds up easily and nicely in it's carrying case (bag).", "Cheap, fragile, poor quality.. I was shocked when I got these after reading so many good reviews.  The sound is inferior, the construction is flimsy at best, and they are no where near as comfortable as they look in the pictures.  If you're looking for high quality headphones, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something of the quality that you get free on the airplane to listen to the in-flight movie, then you can get that for $5 somewhere.", "These are ok but derfinitely not for those who want noise cancelling. I love the way these cans fold up and fit in my bag. The bass notes are more than adequate but the mids and highs seem to be in the background. I'm not totally satisfied with the sound quality but for the price and convenience I'm keeping it. The foam pads are quite  comfortable even after long periods of use and they allow me to still hear events happening around me.", "Great sound. Not for bass junkies. Great sound. Not for bass junkies. I had beats studios before so I was a little under whelmed. But the bass is still good. A bit uncomfortable as well. Ear pads can be changed easily but sound quality will be lower.", "Returned. You get what you pay for.. Despite the numerous positive reviews, I found these head-phones lacking on almost every level. The build quality seems cheap (or rather, it seems appropriate for a $20 pair of headphones), and the sound was not overly impressive. It sounded fine, but what does that really mean? The style seems cooler online, once you're holding them they just look outdated. Not retro-vintage-chic, just old.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nReturned.", "Big Sound for the Buck. Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.", "Best sound for low price. I've had to replace a lost pair of PortaPros and I'm glad the sound quality hasn't changed. I liked the old style straight jack compared with this L-shaped jack, but that's just personal preference and doesn't really affect anything but aesthetics. My only complaint is that I bent the adjustable metal just enough that, while not noticeable visually, it doesn't fit perfectly on my head, which is a little annoying.", "Great sound for the money. I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.", "Amazing product. It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).", "Fantastic for the price.. I had low expectations, but this came highly recommended from an audiophile buddy, as it met very specific requirements for use at work.  I mainly use it for the gym now, since earbuds feel odd for me while running.  Lightweight, the heat\/sweat buildup is low, and not at all bothered by the sound quality.  Yeah, it clearly cant compete with a $300+ set, but its easy to brush off and still get into the music.  My only complaint is that the cable feels fragile.  Everything else feels right.", "Best I've ever owned. They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.", "Awesome!. This is one of the best-valued headphones on the market!\r\r\r\nHaving a clear quality sound (with good bass too!) and a miniature\r\r\r\nbuild that allows for easy transportation. The overall\r\r\r\nconstruction of the headphones seemed a bit flimsy, but the\r\r\r\nlife-time warranty helps to overlook that.\r\r\r\nIt also takes a while to get used to adjusting the size of the\r\r\r\nheadphones and placing them over your year for maximum comfort.", "Want to hear everything as intended - then buy this headphone. Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!", "Resonable sound quality and comfortable. I wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones. This one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears, so doesn't push on the frame. Sound isn't bad either. I use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use.", "Great sound... Not Great Build Quality. Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case broke on me after a year or so of use.... The cable in particular. Cheaply made cables, go with V-Moda", "POOR SOUNDING. These headphones are muddy, muffled, and have very little variation between highs, lows and mid range.  Used only for listening to the news, or something where quality and clarity of sound are not of any importance.  Thumbs down.", "headphones. Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy. Sound quality very good but not outstanding; sound leaks very noticeable.", "Ugly but great.. Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.", "Sound...AMAZING!! Lousy wire though. These are without a doubt the best sounding headphones with dazzling quality! I did my homework and read reviews whatevs...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe only problem though...Is the wire\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy headphones stopped working leaving me twisting until one or both speakers worked.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBest bang for your buck for a pair of headphones\r\r\r\nCon is the THIN WIRE...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDear Koss, if there is ANY way to strengthen the wire PLEASE let me know!!", "Not Impressed At All. I am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone. It does output strong bass, but overall sound is muffled. The high is very weak, barely audible. I prefer the Koss KSC75 and Sennhauser PX100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the PortaPro.", "Excellent sound quality. Like most of you I never listened to these prior to my purchase but read the reviews in detail. The sound quality is extremely good on my iPhone & iPads. Excellent bass, midrange & treble. Very comfortable. Happen to recently own the superb Beyerdynamic A200 p DAC\/Headphone Amp which really turns these headphones to amazing quality sound, but they are still excellent without this.\r\r\r\nIn my opinion these could sell for $200 & still be a good value if you like quality sound from an iPhone.", "Muffled, Muddy, Distorted. Positives:\r\r\r\nComfortable, produce deep base.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNegatives:\r\r\r\nMuffled, muddy, much distortion.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe cord appears to be made of cheap material; inflexible. Based on the lack of sound quality, an appropriate price would be less than $10. The set sent to me really sounded cheap. I tried many types of music files on several playback devices. Maybe they are defective.", "Needs stronger cords, sounds great. Sound quality is great for over the ear headphones, but the cord quality does not stand up. The wires are really thin and be sure not to snag them on anything or they will rip right out. I lost my left cord to a very feeble tree branch.", "Retro goodness - Premium Sound. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate. Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones. The sound quality is far above what you expect. I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones. Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned for wearing with glasses.", "Piece of Junk!. Fell apart in days. One side broke off with normal use. Sound quality not that good. Cheaply made.", "I'm old enough to remember when these came out. Still rockin'. Still excellent sound quality. Love these classic headphones. Really warm toned and well-rounded. If you are hating those tinny-sounding earbuds that make your ears itch, and want a rich smoothness to your jam, try these. For the price, there is not a better sounding portable headphone- ask any audio engineer or sound professional.", "A company with great customer service. I'm no audiophlie, but the sound quality from these open-ear headphones is great for the money. As is the case with any open-ear headphone, there is a lot of sound leakage--so it's not amenable for places where you need to be quiet.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBe forewarned though, that the thin and sharp metal headband might cause discomfort if the fit is bad.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter about six months of rough usage, the plastic clips that hold the two phones together, on the metal headband, snapped. From what I've heard, Koss is great about warranty (and sometimes, even out-of-warranty) replacements.", "Awful headphones, low quality, but most importantly, sound quality is terrible, piercing, and uncomfortable.. The sound quality on these are AWFUL.  I'm sorry, I can't recommend this to anyone no matter how cheap it is.  There's very little bass, and any loudness in the headphone sounds piercing and awful.", "Impressed. I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.", "Fine sound quality, but not comfortable.. I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable. They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.", "Koss Porta pro. Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.", "Great shape, lightweight, good sound.. Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.\r\r\r\nI love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!", "Airplane headphones?. Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.", "Just what I'd hoped for. There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable\/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.", "The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use. The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use; between my phone and laptop, the tip of the smaller cord jack broke off, inside my phone.", "budget headphone best bang for buck!. I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.", "The sound is simply the best. Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews?  Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.", "The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. They are painful to wear, however. And the foam cushions don't last long.", "Doesn't give you nice bass\/sound quality compared to more expensive headsets that cover .... Very compact. Doesn't give you nice bass\/sound quality compared to more expensive headsets that cover your entire ear, but I use it when I go for bike rides, train rides, etc and it works perfectly. My friend and I both bought ours around Christmas time. He told me his broke, but I have yet to break mine.", "headphones. I just received these headphones and could not believe the sound quality for an item at this price. Treat yourself and pick up a pair.", "5 STAR. Have had these for years now.  Best ever!  Sound quality is fantastic, great bass and highs.  Ear pads are inexpensive and easy to replace.  Fit is great even after years of use. No cons.", "Would recommend this product. Bought these for my daughter and she loves them very much and the pouch that came with it is very handy. Would recommend this product. The sound quality is really good and they are comforatable for many hours of use.", "Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are .... Bought my first pair in 1991 and they still work after going through 4 though years of grad school and then being at work since then on a daily basis. Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are not noise canceling at all.  Great quality sound, very comfortable as I have worn them for 10 or more hours straight multiple nights back in school.", "Excellent sound, superb comfort, lacking low-end bass.. Not a bad pair of headphones at all. Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.", "Good Product. Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price", "It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones.. It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones. Just not as good sounds as I thought, or maybe I just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality, downloaded from unreliable source. I confused.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut the good thing is, I can bring it to airplane and don't have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines! yeay!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt's not as pretty as it look from the picture though, I think that Beats by dr. Dre look more sturdier than this.", "GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!", "Underwhelmed.... Read all the reviews before buying it and had expected more.  But in reality I really should not have since I didn't pay too much for it.  The main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isn't stiff enough and I find I have to make sure I'm putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in.

If your looking exaggerated bass response, THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU.", "Great sound for an inexpensive set of headphones. Everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true.  Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the \"standard ear-buds\".  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.", "Great value, good sound, no isolation.. Very good value. Strong bass, good high response, warmish sound. Absolutely no isolation. Because of this, it does leak a bit, but it's not very noticable from more than a foot \/ 1\/3 meter away unless you like to crank the volume.", "great pair of foldable headphones. i already have a set and this was a purchase for my wife. great headphones for the price. they fold and store, have deep clear sound and have a lifetime warranty. my other set got a frayed cord, so for $7 i sent them back and koss replaced them with the newer version! an excellent value for the money. i use them with an ipod and an ipod shuffle and they do the job really well.", "Tasty. Smaller & lighter than you think for over\/the\/ear phones. Breaks down to a compact package travel. Great full spectrum stereo sound and really good bass response.", "Great sound for price range. Awesome sound, especially at this price range.  I didn't want to pay more than $30-40 for headphones, but these were a significant upgrade in sound from my previous (cheaper) pair.  Only downside is that the metal band has a sharp corner that sometime bothers my ear.", "Great. The sound quality is absolutely amazing; they are lightweight and suitable for walking\/hiking.  The only downside is they cannot survive rough treatment so as long as you take delicate care of them, they are a great choice at a reasonable price.", "Awesome sound.  Cool fit.  Folds up nicely.. These have become my go to headphones when I can avoid earbuds.  I travel and they fold up nice in small in their little bag.  They have a stylish, retro fit to them as well.  I compared them to my full size Grado open back headphones and they are almost on par.  Since they have a much smaller cord they are convenient for wearing on the move.  You can also hear everything going on around you with out sacrificing great sound.", "Great headphones. Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.", "Newfound love of overear Headphones.. I hate overear headphones but these I love. They are better than any earbuds and headphones I've ever had. They have great sound and are in my opinion quite durable. Well worth my money I am very pleased with this one.", "not great. i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere."]

Sound quality is all I could ask with strong bass and wonderful clarity and presence.  I have a large head, and the headband adjustment is just adequate, and the phones do need adjustment to remain comfortable after an hour or so.  The unit appears to be of high quality and folds up easily and nicely in it's carrying case (bag).", "they sound great, for about a month. Broke just four days after the return window closed. Good design!", "Cheap, fragile, poor quality.. I was shocked when I got these after reading so many good reviews.  The sound is inferior, the construction is flimsy at best, and they are no where near as comfortable as they look in the pictures.  If you're looking for high quality headphones, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something of the quality that you get free on the airplane to listen to the in-flight movie, then you can get that for $5 somewhere.", "True Value. Product arrived as scheduled and nicely packaged. Had my doubts with the Koss brand as I never believed it was a premier brand. The sound is very nice and balanced. Good bass and not overwhelming. The design is a little outdated but I grew up in the 80's so it is fine with me. In fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Amazon Instant Video. Good bang for your buck and definitely a true value.", "Best Over the Ear Head Phones. Best over the ear headphones at this price range. Back open style may not appeal to everyone but great for commute because you can still hear your surroundings. Very comfortable to wear and does not hurt my ears.\r\r\r\nI listen to the Beatles and other sorts of Rock Music and these headphones play em well. Accurate detailed sound with a good mid range. Bass response is punchy but limited\r\r\r\nNot recommended for Hip Hop or bass heavy Techno, I mean why would you anyways?", "Wasted Money. Good sound, but the spiral cord broke in three places internally after limited use. Cost to repair is near the cost to buy other brand. Wasted $94 on these. Recommend Sennheiser or Audio Technica at about $99.", "Great sound. Not for bass junkies. Great sound. Not for bass junkies. I had beats studios before so I was a little under whelmed. But the bass is still good. A bit uncomfortable as well. Ear pads can be changed easily but sound quality will be lower.", "Good sound, great grantee, great price.. Good high, Good bass, good sound in general. Great guarantee, great price. Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds, like for jogging.", "Big Sound for the Buck. Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.", "Great sound for the money. I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.", "Good phones. Decent, clean sound.  The offset design has advantages and disadvantages.  They fold up all right, but seem to spring back to a pre-set width so you can adjust and leave them in one position.  Not disappointed and the price is pretty good.", "Great sound, affordable. Great sound for the price and seem like they will last for a while.  A good value for the price as well.", "Awesome!. This is one of the best-valued headphones on the market!\r\r\r\nHaving a clear quality sound (with good bass too!) and a miniature\r\r\r\nbuild that allows for easy transportation. The overall\r\r\r\nconstruction of the headphones seemed a bit flimsy, but the\r\r\r\nlife-time warranty helps to overlook that.\r\r\r\nIt also takes a while to get used to adjusting the size of the\r\r\r\nheadphones and placing them over your year for maximum comfort.", "Great value for the price. Super portable and the sound is remarkably good for such an inexpensive set of headphones. I like the retro styling and find them to be quite comfortable, particularly over glasses, compared to other over the ear headphones.", "Koss PortaPro. For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.\r\r\r\nI decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.\r\r\r\nPurchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs.", "not comfortable. the sound is pretty good on these but they are really uncomfortable on my head.  I have lots of unruly hair and it get stuck in it.", "Good headphone for the $ if you can stand its appearance.. Classic headphone has pretty good sound, with pretty strong bass, surprising for an on-ear design with no seal against the ear. Looks dorky, a tad too much pressure against my head, and I'd like more treble. But then I've got a large head, and some high-freq hearing loss, so ymmv.", "Quite good, but the MDR7506 is much better. I got both these, and the similar MDR7506 as well. Contrary to what many reviewers state, these do not not sound quite the same as the MDR7506, which are way much better. Yes, there is a price difference between the two, but I strongly recommend getting the MDR7506 when in doubt.", "They've been making these since 1984 which is all you need to know. I've had mine for years. They sounded good in the 1980's and they sound just as good today.  Plus they come with a 100% iron clad no questions asked lifetime warranty which I had to use when the cord simply wore out back in 2002.  I got my new ones within a week.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSure they look like something out of Star Trek, but the sound is fabulous and they are very comfortable and for under $50, I don't see how you can beat them.", "Best price\/value headphones I ever had.. That's about it, really honest headphones, cheap and the sound is quite balanced. Headband pressure adjustable (firm \/ light). I find the firm a bit too tight but it's a good setting when being active. Totally recommend.", "A classic since 1984. Very good pair of headphones. While not exactly stylish(introduced in 1984),style does`t matter much when you have them on and listen to your music. Very clear,warm,bassy. Frequency response is 15-25000 Hz,impedance 60ohms,101 dB sound pressure level,4ft cord,carry case included. These are great for travel and working out. Their direct competition are Sennheiser PX100-II.Both are highly regarded by audiophiles.", "Excellent sound for a portable headphone. Incredible sound for the size and price, really deep clear bass. I previously had some Skullcandy Lowriders and they didn't sound as good and the plastic headband broke in half, the metal band on these Koss headphones should stand up better to minor daily abuse. The only complaint I have is that you have to re adjust them after every use and since there is no padding on the top the metal band snags my long hair.", "durability?. I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.", "headphones. Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy.

Extremely comfortable.", "Lifetime Warranty and Made in U.S.A.. I've had these for years and they just keep going.  They are light, sound pretty good, fold up very small, and are kind of funky looking.  You can tell that these were designed in the 1980's, but who's going to steal something this ugly?  If they ever malfunction, Koss will repair or replace them, but that hasn't been needed so far.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI don't use them for home use, but for my mp3 player.", "These used to be made better. I had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pair,the replacement pair was not made the same and don't sound as good as my old pair,these are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old model", "Excellent sound. For a good price.. Excellent sound. For a good price.", "GREAT SOUND. YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT.  I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT, I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE, I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE.

I wasn't expecting noise cancellation, but I was expecting something quieter. Otherwise, why am I buying headphones?", "Good enough for a non-audiophile. I love the retro look. For my big head, they don't fit ideally and the adjustments aren't that helpful.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut they sound great, they fold up easily, and they have a lifelong warranty that I hope to never use.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe sound isolation isn't that impressive but aside from that, these are great headphones.", "Among the very best. Some of the very best headphones made. Excellent sound and very good external noise rejection, without the use of electronics.", "Lightweight, compact and portable.  Not much else.. Lightweight but not as comfortable as those with more ear padding.  Good sound.  Not great.  Better than in-ear phones.", "very nice. these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.

Like most of you I never listened to these prior to my purchase but read the reviews in detail. The sound quality is extremely good on my iPhone & iPads. Excellent bass, midrange & treble. Very comfortable. Happen to recently own the superb Beyerdynamic A200 p DAC\/Headphone Amp which really turns these headphones to amazing quality sound, but they are still excellent without this.\r\r\r\nIn my opinion these could sell for $200 & still be a good value if you like quality sound from an iPhone.", "great headset. This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.", "Retro goodness - Premium Sound. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate. Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones. The sound quality is far above what you expect. I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones. Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned for wearing with glasses.", "Great value!. These sound really good for an inexpensive pair of headphones. Nice bass for the money.", "Piece of Junk!. Fell apart in days. One side broke off with normal use. Sound quality not that good. Cheaply made.", "Ugly but good sound. Truly an ugly duckling of a head set. It feels flimsy, and my hair gets caught now and then. But the sound is crisp, tight with solid bass response. That adds one more start to what would be a 3 star rating.", "No good for the long haul.... Sound is good overall but these don't wear well.  Miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates.", "Good Headphones, Great for price. The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.", "Koss. Nice sound.  Still a little bulky to carry but light weight.  Sound was very good. It would have been nice if there was a microphone to use with my iPhone.", "Impressed. I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.", "Three Stars. Sounds good but getting hair stuck on it is quite annoying :(", "Good and Bad. So it folds up.  That's nice.  It sounds pretty good.  That's also nice.  But it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so I'm expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending.", "Fine sound quality, but not comfortable.. I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable. They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.", "Not bad.... Good sound, light weight, ... one of two black head band plastic  retainers fell off.  never was able to find it or an address for a replacement part.", "Great shape, lightweight, good sound.. Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.\r\r\r\nI love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!", "cheaply made, easily broken. skip this product. The ear piece came off the product. The item is cheaply made and broke after 5 total uses while I was exercising. The ear piece can snap back in place but then fall out within a minute. HORRIBLE! The sound is pretty good for the price point, but definitely as good as the sennheiser px100 that some guy wrote about. I had those headphones and the are far the best sub $80 headphones I have ever used. I'm going to be ordering those on Cyber Monday. I returned these cheap pieces of crap.", "Little phones...big sound. For the price, these little phones are really good.  Perfect for small stuff, when big or more expense headphones just won't fit.", "Just what I'd hoped for. There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable\/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.", "Four Stars. these are comfy and sound pretty good. Would have 5 stars if the cord was detachable.", "Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.", "Great sound. Bad design. Alrighty this headphone is so good at producing very accurate sound considering its price. There is one design flaw and it was very prominently let it down for me. The steel bars will snatch your hair while adjusting or placing the phone over your head. Also the cables are weak and broke for me. Now I upgraded to M50 and feel so much better", "Nothing beats Koss for good sound on a small budget. Nothing beats Koss for good sound on a small budget. This model, however, is flimsy. Without the mic, 5 starts.", "Bad wires. The cords always seemed stiff.  The wires broke inside the cords at the strain relief after six months.  Almost any removal of the phones causes them to reset to the tightest fitting.  Good sound, but generally poor design.", "The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. They are painful to wear, however. And the foam cushions don't last long.", "Great Headphones. I saw these retro headphones and thought no way. After I read the review by CNET and others I decided to give them a try. Glad i did becasue they are great. They are light, comfortable for long use, adjustable and the sound is really good.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n* it is true that they may pull out a hair or two at the top of the slider at your head.", "Pretty good.. These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPROS\r\r\r\n- Sound is great, bass and all.\r\r\r\n- iPod\/iPhone friendly plug.\r\r\r\n- Lightweight and comfortable.\r\r\r\n- The price is right.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONS\r\r\r\n- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.\r\r\r\n- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.", "They Really Are Good. I'm a pretty discerning audiophile, and I would say that the reviews of these headphones are justified.  Using them with an IPod they were very musical and detailed, without an overhyped or overemphasized sound (ie exaggerated bass or dry or shrill treble). An obvious improvement over the included Ipod headphones.  For the price, pretty much an easy choice.  They are comfortable to wear, only limitation is that they offer some, but not much, isolation from external noise.", "Would recommend this product. Bought these for my daughter and she loves them very much and the pouch that came with it is very handy. Would recommend this product. The sound quality is really good and they are comforatable for many hours of use.", "Good Product. Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price", "It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones.. It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones. Just not as good sounds as I thought, or maybe I just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality, downloaded from unreliable source. I confused.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut the good thing is, I can bring it to airplane and don't have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines! yeay!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt's not as pretty as it look from the picture though, I think that Beats by dr. Dre look more sturdier than this.", "Koss PortaPro sounds very good and a great value. Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.", "lightweight sound for lightweight money. was amazed at the price. not very good at isolation from the outside world. fit was improved by a slight bending of the bands to more securely fit the headphones to my head. for a low cost option to the mega dollar phones these are a good deal.", "Good sound quality, poor construction. good sound! But very chintzy material and construction. It's going back.", "Surprising for the price. For the cash you can't get better. Plus: clear sound, low power consumption, comfy pads Minus: not really collapsible, hard to adjust firmness buttons, hair gets caught in band (and I have very short hair). Mated with Cowon's I7, you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound. Not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes. Glad I purchased the oldie but goodie.", "Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.", "Very good phones. I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.", "Great headphones. I love these headphones. This is the second pair I've purchased (I wanted another pair for the office). I've used the first pair for years. The sound is very good - not artificially heavy on bass. I use them to listen to music in iTunes and Pandora. They are also comfortable to wear. If I could change one thing, I'd change the heavy coiled cable for something lighter.", "Good for music and editing. Love 'em! They travel well, in spite of their size relative to earbuds. They fold up and go in a carry-on bag with no problems. They have great sound. I bought them for music and audio editing.", "Good sound but not the quality build of years gone by. I had a pair of these in the 90s which had a stellar build, excellent audio quality, and lasted for years and years with hard use. I purchased this pair in 2014.  The audio quality is good.  Unfortunately, the build quality is not great.  I've given this pair moderate use, and the black ear cup lining is falling off -- exposing loose foam that won't last.", "good. good headphones, worth the money. i agree with others that the band that sits on your nead does catch your hair, thats about the only negative thing i can say, as far as the sound goes there good!", "prefer Sportapro. I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.", "Greatest portable headphones under $100. Best portable headphones for under $50, maybe even $100. Had Koss headphone ear clips (ksc 55?) back in 2000 when they tried to get into the urban streetstyle market. I remember those headphones being great sounding, just a bad heavy design for clips.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese here are the best. Sounds great and natural. Staging is good. And are incredibly comfortable.

Compared to my 200$ fidelio l1s, these sound fairly similar, in terms of sound signature, but (obviously) a completely different build.

They sound much more expensive then they are and represent a very good deal.", "Great value, good sound, no isolation.. Very good value. Strong bass, good high response, warmish sound. Absolutely no isolation. Because of this, it does leak a bit, but it's not very noticable from more than a foot \/ 1\/3 meter away unless you like to crank the volume.", "Tasty. Smaller & lighter than you think for over\/the\/ear phones. Breaks down to a compact package travel. Great full spectrum stereo sound and really good bass response.", "Good quality in a small package.. These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.\r\r\r\nOn the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.", "Not for me. The sound was good. But I never got these adjusted to be comfortable with my glasses, and the foam pads don't feel very substantial. As a result, I don't wear them. I keep using my earbuds instead.", "Good sound, but there are others that are its equal.. The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the \"Tension Adjustment\" for the earpads are fiddly.  I find that the Sennheiser PX-100 or the AKG K420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort.", "Not even worth their cheap price. Flimsy, finicky folding mechanism and mediocre sound. Don't know how these get such good reviews.", "One of the best headphones I have ever used. These are one of the best sounding headphones I have ever heard. These things have crisp, clean audio, and good bass. The soundstage\/immersion is also really good as well. These headphones fold up and include a carrying case which also make them perfect for travel, although the cord is a bit long (but is better then having a cord that is too short however), since the cord is coiled it can stretch really far. You definitely cannot go wrong with these headphones.", "I really like these headphones. I really like these headphones. Besides these, I also have the Bose AE2s and the Monster DNAs. Each pair has their advantages (Bose is very comfortable and has good sound, Monsters have monster bass and can share their sound), but I like these the best. Best of all, they were actually the least expensive.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe sound is very clean and balanced. These are classics for a reason.", "Good phones for an Ipod device. Who ever designed these head phone are out of the box for sound.,These headphones are incredible. Cheap but not resilient. You got to take care of them.

If you do NOT need portability as your overriding choice factor, you can do MUCH better with other Koss headphone models or other top rated brands... so keep looking.", "Not for me. The sound was good. But I never got these adjusted to be comfortable with my glasses, and the foam pads don't feel very substantial. As a result, I don't wear them.

As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image. Overall I think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review. They've also been surprisingly durable.", "Best Over the Ear Head Phones. Best over the ear headphones at this price range. Back open style may not appeal to everyone but great for commute because you can still hear your surroundings. Very comfortable to wear and does not hurt my ears.\r\r\r\nI listen to the Beatles and other sorts of Rock Music and these headphones play em well. Accurate detailed sound with a good mid range. Bass response is punchy but limited\r\r\r\nNot recommended for Hip Hop or bass heavy Techno, I mean why would you anyways?", "the sound is great as is the portability. This is my second pair and for the price, the sound is great as is the portability.", "Good sound, great grantee, great price.. Good high, Good bass, good sound in general. Great guarantee, great price. Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds, like for jogging.", "Best headphones I've owned!. Recommended by CNET, these headphones are light, portable, and have the best sound I've heard in this price range.\r\r\r\nI originally bought them for a laptop, and now I use them on every audio device I own. Great product, excellent price.", "Great sound for the money. I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.", "Amazing product. It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).", "Nice for price. Has great sound, it only goes on one way and have to reset the fitting by pulling down each time but I like'em.", "Great sound, affordable. Great sound for the price and seem like they will last for a while.  A good value for the price as well.", "Great value for the price.

Only problem is that I recently shaved my head bald, and it's now somewhat annoying having the sharp metal band and plastic brackets digging in to the top of my head, but it's not a problem for most people, I'm sure.  Other than that, I'm very happy and would recommend them to anyone.  They're durable as well - they took a trip to Thailand and back with me, completely unharmed (I live in the US).", "I guess it's good for the price but I personally do not like ....

Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.", "Sounds great, one small design problem. I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.", "Great Old School Headphone at a great old school price. Sound is.

Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !", "Great Sounding but Ugly. You'd be hard pressed to find better sounding headphones for the price.  However, the 30-year old retro design might make you be hesitant to listen to that great sound in public!  If you can get past the looks, you'll certainly be pleased with these headphones.  Don't be surprised if they blow off the doors of your trendy looking Beats headphones!  Also, you are covered by the Koss no-questions-asked lifetime warranty.  The one-star deduction is only due to the aesthetics.", "OK for the price. Sounds good, but not great.  Will do the job.  Would not recommend for music. what else can I say about them?", "Great value. These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat.  I use them frequently.  I did not give them 5 stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use (2+ hours) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by.", "Good Headphones, Great for price. The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.

I love these because they stay on your head, so you can use them for working out. There are better headphones, but not in this price range, and those will fall off your head if you lean\/bend when exercising\/dancing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSome people use ear buds, but I do not like anything in my ear for more reasons than one.", "Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.", "Great sound. Bad design. Alrighty this headphone is so good at producing very accurate sound considering its price. There is one design flaw and it was very prominently let it down for me. The steel bars will snatch your hair while adjusting or placing the phone over your head. Also the cables are weak and broke for me. Now I upgraded to M50 and feel so much better", "What a Great Buy. Great Sound for the price! While it may look retro, the sound it creates can't be beat for the price you pay.", "Pretty good.. These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPROS\r\r\r\n- Sound is great, bass and all.\r\r\r\n- iPod\/iPhone friendly plug.\r\r\r\n- Lightweight and comfortable.\r\r\r\n- The price is right.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONS\r\r\r\n- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.\r\r\r\n- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.", "GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!", "like them. audio quality is great for the price bracket, but they feel flimsy. However, I haven't goofed up and done anything bad to them yet. I just wish that the build quality was a little better so I wouldn't be paranoid every time I used them.", "Koss PortaPro sounds very good and a great value.

For the price one of the best portable Headphones I have owned.  Great sound and light weight", "Either love it or hate it. Classic for a reason. Great sound, great looks (imo) and sturdy construction. Love that it comes with a leather carrying case. Koss has been in the game for a long time. A quick search of this headphone on any respected audio\/video forum will reveal largely positive reviews for excellent sound quality compared to the price point.", "Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.", "Very good phones. I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.", "Great sound for the price. Great sound for the price. They have a very expansive and detailed sound with plenty of bass for such small drivers. They're super light but can be uncomfortable based on the locking mechanism on the earpad swivel. Some people also complain about their hair getting caught in the headband. If you don't like in-ear headphones and want something for traveling without any outside noise-blocking, these would be a great choice, IMO.", "Great Headphones. Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.", "Portability and Easy Listening. Pros:\r\r\r\n- Sound is decent for its price\r\r\r\n- Very compact when folded and placed in case; great for traveling.\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n- No noise cancellation\r\r\r\n- When adjusting, band gets separated causing hair to get stuck in the band; quite painful.\r\r\r\nNotes:\r\r\r\n- To adjust without worrying about hair, it's best to adjust it to the maximum length and then place it on your head and push the sides of the metal bands together until it fits.", "great pair of foldable headphones. i already have a set and this was a purchase for my wife. great headphones for the price. they fold and store, have deep clear sound and have a lifetime warranty. my other set got a frayed cord, so for $7 i sent them back and koss replaced them with the newer version! an excellent value for the money. i use them with an ipod and an ipod shuffle and they do the job really well.", "Great sound for price range. Awesome sound, especially at this price range.  I didn't want to pay more than $30-40 for headphones, but these were a significant upgrade in sound from my previous (cheaper) pair.  Only downside is that the metal band has a sharp corner that sometime bothers my ear.", "Great. The sound quality is absolutely amazing; they are lightweight and suitable for walking\/hiking.  The only downside is they cannot survive rough treatment so as long as you take delicate care of them, they are a great choice at a reasonable price.", "Great Headphones! Great price!!. Fantastic pair of Headphones. Great highs & lows, & probably the most comfortable phones I've ever used."]

The Sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones.  The ear pads will fall apart after a year or two, so expect to have to replace them.  This happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad.  This isn't unique to Sony.",

These are outstanding headphones for the price, with excellent response across the frequency spectrum, and especially robust bass for such a small, lightweight set.  A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either.",

The set is comfortable, and the cups insulates noises well (not to compare to noise-canceling headphones).  All that said, I still feel that the set should cost at $15-$20 less.",

It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.",

I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).",

My son is a computer game fanatic, and I thought that he'd eventually want to upgrade from these. However, after two years of use, and replacing the worn out ear pads, he's still happy with their performance, to my surprise, as he often wants the latest, and greatest, but is still very satisfied with these. Hmmm, no wonder many radio stations around the country, use these as well, imo, they are a proven performer.",

These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.",

The only drawback of these are the ear covers that tend to flake off.  Yes the oils around your ear will get on the ear pads.  I gently wipe them off occasionally.  However at some point they do wear off.  They sell replacement ear pads and third party manufacturers sell them cheap.",

I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible.

Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.",

Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.",

Soundwise, they are too bright, lacking mostly in mid-bass (100-500Hz area). I'm not a bass-head at all, and these seem to have some of the typical deep\/DJ bass. Sound is just plain thin. Otherwise they are louder than Senn 201 at the same volume setting, so I guess they are more efficient.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNot bad for 70$ if you listen to light jazz of acoustic; there are better cans otherwise.",

They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.  I went without nice headphones for several years, I am very happy that they still sell this model, they are compact, have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame.  They are by far the best value in headphones, kudos for Sony for keeping production running.",

Its virtually identical except for using chrome instead of gold on some of the metal parts and a slightly less bright EQ. The MDR-7506 has just a bit more sizzle, as if you were sitting a little closer to the band. I like them both.",

The buttons for adjusting the headphones to your head size do not work.  The headband is extremely flimsy and catches on hair. And I ended my first day using these with a massive headache because they were just too tight and could not be adjusted for proper fitting.  Koss - back to the drawing board.", "Nice headphones. Great sound,very comfortable .I bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older Sony set. I bought the older Sony from EBAY,beware when doing this,it was a fake Sony. Bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the Sony MDR-V6 was inferior. The fakes are hard to detect,there are web sites that go over ways to check.", "Happy ears. Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWhat Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHappy ears.", "Good sound - a little Tinny (not Tiny). These are good quality sounding headphone (just a little bit tinny) and has a comfortable headband with multi stereo adapters. Only but... is the cheapy black sponge foam ear pads don't last more than a year with daily use.", "Excellent Headphones. Beautiful sound.  Very clear highs and solid bass.  I also have Sony noise-cancelling phones.  I love Sony products.  Very dependable quality.", "SONY V6 EARPHONES. GOT THESE EARPHONE TODAY AND WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED, HOWEVER, BY THE EXPOSED WIRES CONNECTING EACH SIDE OF THE EARPHONES.  THESE EARPHONES SOUND VERY GOOD WITH SOLID BASS AND OVERALL CLARITY. THEY DID SEEM A LITTLE HARSH ON THE HIGH SIDE, BUT WERE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.  WHILE I LIKE THE OVERALL SOUND OF THESE EARPHONES, THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS SMOOTH AS MY JVC HA-DX3 EARPHONES, WHICH I CONSIDER THE VERY BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD.", "Very impressed. Excellent sound, very comfortable fit, the great quality I have come to expect from Sony products.", "Studio monitor headphones. love the product. produces clear sound really blown away on the quality of sound it produces...", "I would recommend these headphones... I am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound, I would definitely recommend these. I also have sennheisers at the same price and I felt Sony this was better than those head headphones. They are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem. They look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packing.", "Perfect for all music genres! Superb sound quality!. I have always been fascinated by music, and I have also heard my share of symphonies and life performances in my day. With that being said, I LOVE these headphones. Before them, I had Bose Triports. However, these far outshine them in every way. Since they are studio monitor headphones, they really do sound great with every genre. They are definitely worth the buy!", "sound quality. fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement", "These are the most comfortable things my ears have ever had the privilege to .... These are the most comfortable things my ears have ever had the privilege to come into contact with. A+\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound quality is great too.", "still the best headphones. I have had the Koss PortaPro Headphones for many years, so recently ordered another, one for myself and one for my wife.  They are still the best for quality of sound and compactability.", "Very good sound quality and reasonably priced.. Thank you Sony. This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.", "Great Sound!. Great headphones for the price. The quality is amazing, I can hear sounds I never did with my small earbuds. Although after an hour or so your ears get warm the sound quality makes up for it!!", "Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case. The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.", "Can't beat them.. Bought these on Black Friday at almost half the cost, to replace a pair that I got twenty years ago or so.  The old ones have lost a little bit of their sound quality, but still work fine, although the coating has worn off the pads.  These new ones are a noticeable improvement in sound.", "The MDRV6s are superior to the MDR7506. Had these headphones evaluated side by side with the Sony MDR7506. Twice. The MDRV6s are superior to the latter. They have more balanced, neutral, accurate range which is much better for quality music listening. The MDR7506, although also good, are overly bright, with less bass and thinner sound.", "Worth the Investment. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase these headphones. I'm really glad I did. They arrived quickly in the mail after my order was placed. They are the highest quality headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is great and they fold up nicely. I have not experienced the discomfort that some other reviewers have complained about. My only complaint is that the cord is long and not detachable", "Kickin in the beat. These headphones are .....sleek....compact....durable....and most importantly do provide superior sound quality.  I got these instead of other pairs b\/c of all the fantabulous reviews on here, and they are pretty good. the sound really does sound perfect, and it has really really good bass, not too distorted, just enough to sound good.  plus, they come with a nice leather-esque carrying case with a rope on the top so you can cinch them up and take them anywhere.", "Excellent. For the price, these can't be beat.. For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones.", "These work great. My son really loves these headphones. The really cut out external sounds well and sound very full. For the cost, it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound.", "Best headphones I've owned, great value for price. Best headphones I've ever owned. Very comfortable, light over-the-ear headphones. The sound is very crisp, and I definitely hear things in my music that I hadn't heard before. These are great value for the price, and are definitely higher quality than more expensive headphones I've owned (e.g. Bose). I wear glasses, and these are surprisingly comfortable even with my glasses. They're also very comfortable for long periods of time (an entire work day), unlike many on-ear head phones and in-ear earphones. Would recommend and purchase again.", "Great product for the price. I spent a lot of time researching and reading product reviews before settling on this headphone. I was not disappointed. It has better than average quality and it sounds great. My only complaint are the ear pads. My first look at them made me feel that they will not last long. They are not deep enough to prevent earphone from sitting on my ears. I don't wear them for extended periods so no problem for me.", "great. quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.", "Durable headphones with high-quality sound. These headphones provide extremely high quality sound (including excellent bass).  You will notice a huge difference if you are used to cheap headphones or low-end speakers.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are also durable.  In the three years that I've owned mine, I haven't had any problems except for the foam earpads deteriorating.  These can be replaced for $7 on Amazon, however.", "Just OK. Fits too tight and hurts my ears after awhile. Been using Sony headphones for years and the quality has gone steadily down hill. Sound quality is just OK, nothing to get excited about.", "Seems good on every aspect. As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.", "Good overall but not for heavy bass likers. I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.", "Solid. Sturdy, comfortable, and high sound quality. What more would you like in a set of headphones? This is the second headphone set I've owned from Sony, and both were high quality items.", "Good product with reasnable price. It's really a gud product and worth paying so much money for this. One thing that i noticed is it starts swaeting after couple of hours. This might a prob with me only. On the other hand it has a gud bass and sound quality. I recommend this product.", "SoundHead. Great headphones!!!  Clear and precise sound, very comfortable fit.  Sony quality to boot!!!", "Best All Around Headphones at a Great Price!. I wanted a set of headphones that were comfortable enough so I could wear them all day while editing, with great sound quality and durable enough to take in the field.  After talking with several others that have been working in production for years, the V6 kept coming up.  I love these headphones, they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!", "Great sound, perfect fit. We're moving to an open floor plan at work to enhance \"collaboration\" which means it's going to get considerably louder and harder to concentrate.  I was looking for a decent pair of over the ear headphones and these rated pretty highly in my price range.  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).", "If Not For The Flaking.... They are the real deal. Studio quality. Bummer that the shiny top layer of the ear cushions flake off. Feels good, sounds good, collapses into a small package. Would buy again.", "Sony can't keep its superior design and quality as the old days. The sound quality had compromised compare to the same one I purchased in 1995. Sony can't keep its superior design and quality as the old days.", "Good sound, bad ear pads. The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good, just lacking bass like a lot of headphones. They're comfortable, and the over-the-ear style reduces ambient noise but doesn't get too hot or heavy. The one problem is the ear pads, which don't hold up well. After three years they're starting to shred. These headphones don't get heavy use and the ear pads should last a lot longer. Replacements are available, though, and I plan to keep using the headphones.", "Quality product, good sound, but after 1 hour uncomfortable.. I bought these during a special Amazon sale at half price.  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I use these at night when I watch TV or movies in bed.  Last night was my first try with them.  I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones, but like a few others have noted in their reviews, after about an hour I found them uncomfortable.  I replaced another pair of Sony headphones that I've had for over 5 years and those were never uncomfortable.", "Awesome!. I bought these headphones for my husband when he goes on business trips, for the plane. He uses them all the time. He works from home the majority of the time, and if the kids or the dog get too loud, he just pops these babies on and fades into his own world... Great sound quality, too, he says.", "Mediocre product.. Bought these for my husband who listens\/records music constantly. While they have a good sound quality, the material covering the ear phones part has begun to separate, exposing the padding inside the ear phone. We are disappointed in the quality of the product.", "These headphones are sooo comfortable, this is the most important feature. These headphones are sooo comfortable, this is the most important feature...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound quality is amazing, true sound. Not \"enhanced\" like other manufacturers do.", "amazing sound quality and 100% satisfied. I purchased this headphones on Nov, 2012, and have been using it for two years, amazing sound quality and 100% satisfied. Do not get any disappoint when it arrived, keep using it for couple month and you will find out the truth.", "Sound quality is great!. I like this headset, sound quality was great!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNote:\r\r\r\nCord is long.. No I mean really Long...\r\r\r\nIt has an adapter for the large audio jack\r\r\r\nThey are adjustable for size\r\r\r\nThe ear pads are nice and soft", "perfect. Bought these years ago. Have had to replace the ear cushions once. Still gets a little uncomfortable for long periods, but I stretched out the headband a bit for that. sound quality is still amazing.", "Great desk headphones!. Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.", "Excellent headphones with real studio headphone sound. I tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound. I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better. These are just right.", "Good, but go with the MDR7506 instead.. Has a sharp hissing quality to some of the high S sounds. Hardware is pretty much identical to the MDR7506 and some people say it sounds a bit different but still as good, but really the MDR7506 sounds better.", "Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.", "Recording quality, or lack thereof, really comes out with these. I've never owned real fancy headphones. I had some Bose noise-canceling ones that eventually broke and I didn't want to spend another ton of money. These are very comfortable and I thoroughly enjoy listening to my music as it surrounds my head. Nothing harsh or overpowering. Just a well-balanced sound.", "Good quality OTH Headphones without the high price. These are quality headphones that are very well priced. They are comfortable and have decent sound reproduction for the price.", "Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.", "Same Sony Quality. The quality is what you would expect of Sony, consistent and well made. I also am a Bose enthusiast, but I was impressed with all the specs on the Sony Digital headset, so I thought I would give them a try.  I was not let down, they fit good, comfort is good and the sound quality is very good.", "Great Headphones. Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGreat value. Just buy them.", "GREAT headphones. GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.", "I like the sound. there's like almost 1000 reviews at the time of writing this.  I can only say the quality it very good.  I have ears which approach a size only talked about in National Geographic.  So the one issue I have is the pads are too small.", "High Quality, Very Nice Sound!. A bit large, a bit heavy, they get kind of warm if you've had them on for a while, and the coiled cord is a bit clumsy.  However, they sound really great; and, I'd clearly buy them again!", "great purchase indeed.. unbelievable sound quality enough said.\r\r\r\ni just got these head phones and tried it on my piano keyboard and i was just blow away by the bass quality and the rest tones of the audio range.\r\r\r\ni always trust sony products...well done.", "Five Stars. Good sound quality.  I like the sound better than the Bose AE2.", "Amazing, long lasting headphones.. I love these headphones. These are the exact headphones my dad has had for 20+ years. Amazing sound quality and extremely comfortable. And they must last long, since my dad still has his. What more can I say? They're amazing.", "Five Stars. Great quality stereo sound with these headphones.  So glad I purchased them, well worth the money.", "Excellent Quality Sound, Can't Hear Outside Sounds. I've had these headphones on at a reasonable volume, and I cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me.  The sound quality is excellent.  I want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine.", "Great sound. Really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones.  They fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on."]

They were still under warranty but they wanted me to pay for the repair.", "Great headphones, pads are a little uncomfortable.. Great sounding headphones for the money! If you're familiar with Sony audio products you know that they're pretty much junk but the headphones are an exception to the rule. These can easily beat much more expensive headphones and beats or bose can't even come close, much less in the $50-100 range.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMinus one star for the pads being pretty uncomfortable, I added a pair of Brainwavz angled memory foam pads for $25 to turn them into a great pair of headphones.", "Nice headphones.

Excellent sound, very comfortable fit, the great quality I have come to expect from Sony products.", "Five Star Headphones. These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange.

It has better than average quality and it sounds great. My only complaint are the ear pads. My first look at them made me feel that they will not last long. They are not deep enough to prevent earphone from sitting on my ears. I don't wear them for extended periods so no problem for me.", "Great for home stereo. I'd been wanting these for awhile and was able to get them as a daily deal at a great price. I've been using them in rotation with other headphones on my computer system and they were very clean and neutral. I might add that they are very comfortable as well.

They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great.", "SONY MDR-V6.

I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!", "Great sound, perfect fit. We're moving to an open floor plan at work to enhance \"collaboration\" which means it's going to get considerably louder and harder to concentrate.  I was looking for a decent pair of over the ear headphones and these rated pretty highly in my price range.  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).", "Very good headphone for the price!. I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price", "Best headphones for the price. This is simply the best sounding headphones for under $100.  The bass is incredible, the sound is crispy clear.  When I commute in the train, I can hardly hear any noise, and the comfort is great.", "Nice sound and fit.

They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.", "Awesome!. I bought these headphones for my husband when he goes on business trips, for the plane. He uses them all the time.

Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.", "Great sound with great bass hands down.. Need I say more about these?  These are decades old and STILL better than those gimmicky Beats crap headphones.  The only drawback of these are the ear covers that tend to flake off.  Yes the oils around your ear will get on the ear pads.  I gently wipe them off occasionally.  However at some point they do wear off.  They sell replacement ear pads and third party manufacturers sell them cheap.", "Blown away by these. Wow I had no idea how good these were til they came in. Blew my expectations out of the water and became one of my favorite headphones ever even over my Bose. great comfort; they run with a flat EQ so you will need a program to change the EQ settings for the sound to get that perfect sound.", "Audophile and pleasantly surprised!. I probably have 10 different styles of headphones, Bose, Beats, in-ear style sport headphones, etc.  The sound on these rank above all of the others and the price is great! I can see why these headphones have stood the test of time. I like that you can cheaply replace the parts should the need arise. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.", "Great for Rock and current pop, less so for classical. This headphone is especially good for rock, less so for classical.  It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.", "feels cheap and plasticky but sounds great.. I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug, these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5.00 i could not pass them up. They're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices.", "Excellent over-the-ear sound !!!. After spending a great deal more money at a large retailer and being very dissapointed, I ordered these headphones. The sound is fantastic for all around music. I listen to TOOL, Pink Floyd, John Mayer, SADE and SRV. Whether I am listening to classical or blues these headphones really surround you.", "10 years later.... ...and still going strong and sounding great. Must be the ultimate bargain in headphones.", "Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.", "Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.

The Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series sound great and for the price are a very good purchase.

Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anybody in the market for a mid priced set of headphones. Work great for both music and watching TV late at night.", "Superior Response On Vocals.

I have tried senns, sonys, skullcandys and numerous other brands and none sound as good as the porta pro's. the headphones really sound great, excellent actually. it is hard to beat these headphones, throw in the lifetime no questions ask warranty and it really is a no brainer. the only flaw i see is that it can at times pull your hair when taking them on\/off.", "The MDRV6s are superior to the MDR7506. Had these headphones evaluated side by side with the Sony MDR7506. Twice. The MDRV6s are superior to the latter. They have more balanced, neutral, accurate range which is much better for quality music listening. The MDR7506, although also good, are overly bright, with less bass and thinner sound.", "Kickin in the beat. These headphones are .....sleek....compact....durable....and most importantly do provide superior sound quality.  I got these instead of other pairs b\/c of all the fantabulous reviews on here, and they are pretty good. the sound really does sound perfect, and it has really really good bass, not too distorted, just enough to sound good.  plus, they come with a nice leather-esque carrying case with a rope on the top so you can cinch them up and take them anywhere.", "Well worth the money. Finding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue ... until now. These are the real deal. The only point I give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord. It's long and somewhat bulky, but manageable. The sound reproduction, particularly at the bass end, is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDon't bother looking further. I've done it and tried most of them. I'd put these up against anything else, even more expensive brands, on the market.", "Great Headphones. Fit is a little big.. I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.", "These are one of the best headphones in their price range. These are one of the best headphones in their price range. Comfortable, killer sound, and reasonably closed (they don't isolate you entirely, which I think it's good). The choice of the pros for decades.", "The best!. I've owned or tried some of the best headphones out there. For the money, these are far and away the best value. No, they aren't noise cancelling, but the large over the ear pads completely cover the ear and block out 99% of the sound anyhow. You won't regret buying these unless Bose has succeeded in convincing you that you have to spend $300 to get good sound.", "Sweet sounding for a great price.. These phones are really comfortable. I have flown overseas and worn them for hours at a time with no problem. They sound really good and for the price, I don't think you can beat em.", "Descent sound for the price. I paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago. I think it's 10 to 15 less now.  They're worth $70 so if they've dropped in price then they're definitely worth it. Sound is good for digital stereo, but won't compare to a surround sound headphone. If all you need is stereo you won't be disappointed.", "Good, but not fits my ears. The sound is pretty good. But it is not so comfortable when I use it for long time. (not fits)", "Seems good on every aspect. As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.", "Good overall but not for heavy bass likers. I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.", "these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when .... Was using the v600s until they discontinued them. At this price point, these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when I DJ.  There's definitely a break-in period and they sound even better after a few hours of use.", "Good product with reasnable price. It's really a gud product and worth paying so much money for this. One thing that i noticed is it starts swaeting after couple of hours. This might a prob with me only. On the other hand it has a gud bass and sound quality. I recommend this product.", "If Not For The Flaking.... They are the real deal. Studio quality. Bummer that the shiny top layer of the ear cushions flake off. Feels good, sounds good, collapses into a small package. Would buy again.", "Very good headphone for the price!. I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price", "My first. These provide a nice fit and good sound.  Sometimes I can hear background noise but I never used headphones so I cannot compare.", "Happy with mine. Good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded. If you want something for recreational music listening, these might not be for you thought I don't see why these couldn't be used for that. These have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etc.", "Good sound, bad ear pads. The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good, just lacking bass like a lot of headphones. They're comfortable, and the over-the-ear style reduces ambient noise but doesn't get too hot or heavy. The one problem is the ear pads, which don't hold up well. After three years they're starting to shred. These headphones don't get heavy use and the ear pads should last a lot longer. Replacements are available, though, and I plan to keep using the headphones.", "Quality product, good sound, but after 1 hour uncomfortable.. I bought these during a special Amazon sale at half price.  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I use these at night when I watch TV or movies in bed.  Last night was my first try with them.  I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones, but like a few others have noted in their reviews, after about an hour I found them uncomfortable.  I replaced another pair of Sony headphones that I've had for over 5 years and those were never uncomfortable.", "Uncomfortable, mediocre sound, annoying cable. I used to think Sony MDRs were top of the heap. But these cheap headphones don't hold a candle to my Bose QC15s.

Pros -\r\r\r\nThe audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs, the build looks solid that will last years\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons -\r\r\r\nHeavy and uncomfortable. It presses hard on ears so you can't listen to for long time!\r\r\r\nI returned to to get more comfortable ones even though I got these ones at very good price 49$ from Amazon", "Mediocre product.. Bought these for my husband who listens\/records music constantly. While they have a good sound quality, the material covering the ear phones part has begun to separate, exposing the padding inside the ear phone. We are disappointed in the quality of the product.", "I thought it would sound amazing for it's price. After reading all the raving reviews, I thought it would sound amazing for it's price, but I thought it was mediocre. It didn't surprise me. it's not very good for an everyday carry either because of the way it's built.", "Great headphones. Bought these for someone else as a gift and they felt and sounded so good I decided to keep them for myself.", "Really good for editing and keeping out extraneous noise.. I use this for work cutting sound and music on an AVID. I am usually startled by people coming in my room because I can never hear them knock.", "Great desk headphones!. Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.", "Blown away by these. Wow I had no idea how good these were til they came in. Blew my expectations out of the water and became one of my favorite headphones ever even over my Bose. great comfort; they run with a flat EQ so you will need a program to change the EQ settings for the sound to get that perfect sound.", "Great for Rock and current pop, less so for classical. This headphone is especially good for rock, less so for classical.  It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.", "Good, but go with the MDR7506 instead.. Has a sharp hissing quality to some of the high S sounds. Hardware is pretty much identical to the MDR7506 and some people say it sounds a bit different but still as good, but really the MDR7506 sounds better.", "Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.", "terrific value. and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice.", "Incredible sound.. These are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish. OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.", "Good quality OTH Headphones without the high price. These are quality headphones that are very well priced. They are comfortable and have decent sound reproduction for the price.", "Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.", "Same Sony Quality. The quality is what you would expect of Sony, consistent and well made. I also am a Bose enthusiast, but I was impressed with all the specs on the Sony Digital headset, so I thought I would give them a try.  I was not let down, they fit good, comfort is good and the sound quality is very good.", "GREAT headphones. GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.", "line cord too weak. The sound is good but the design has a flaw and that is  the connection between the line cord and the ear piece lose connectivity.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI have been using for a year and still works ok", "I like the sound. there's like almost 1000 reviews at the time of writing this.  I can only say the quality it very good.  I have ears which approach a size only talked about in National Geographic.  So the one issue I have is the pads are too small.", "What I found is when the source has good bass, it sounds awesome. One thing about this headphone is it reproduces the source faithfully.  Some people complained that the bass was weak. But most likely the source has weak bass to begin with.  What I found is when the source has good bass, it sounds awesome.  I played some Japanese Taiko music and it sounds like the floor is reverberating with each beat.  It is a really nice phone but is fairly unforgiving of the flaws in the source recording.", "Nice Headsetf or the price.. Can't complain. These have good sound at a very reasonable price. They do lack a bit in bass for my taste but I am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected. I did almost have to max out the volume on my mp3 player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier. All in all a good buy.", "Yep...these are magic!. I had the MDR-V6s in the early 1990s...loved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with MDR-V600s. I was never happy with the V600s and now 20 years later just replaced them with the MDR-V6. Right out of the box...instant clarity, deep accurate bass, an articulate musical sound. Not sure what the V6 has that makes it so good.", "Using them, it is obvious why they have been selling for so long. They sound every bit as good as my ear-surrounding headphones.

The bass is incredible, the sound is crispy clear.  When I commute in the train, I can hardly hear any noise, and the comfort is great.", "Great headphones for the $$$. Sure, there are better and worse headphones out there, but, for the price, these are tough to beat imo.

These headphones are an excellent choice for the price. Comfortable fit, brilliant highs, booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking. Even with no input I have to take them off to have a conversation. Overall - just another really great product from Sony. You can get much better cans than these, but not at this price.", "Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.", "Best headphones for the price. I have owned two pairs of these since 1988.  They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then.  They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.

I tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound. I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better.

Not the greatest treble detail.  I bought these to replace an old pair of Sony MDR-V6's and after listening for quite a while concluded that the Sony's have much more accurate bass and treble. Not really adequate for critical monitoring. They really clamp your head pretty hard.",

I have tried Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds, a Razer Carcharias headset, and some NuForce earbuds, none of those even come close to these as far as how clear and balanced the sounds are. The bass is incredibly tight and present when needed, but doesn't mess up the rest of the music like some other headphones do. Buy them! You won't regret it.",

Probably about 20-25 hours and then they seem to sound better, especially in the midrange. Still a good value!",

I have to cushion the top part with fat scrunchies so that the cups can rest OVER my ears and not totally putting the weight of the headphones on the tops of my ears! OUCH!!! They're too small for all that weight! But I've always had problems with headphones fitting properly, though, so EHHH what else is new? I'm just glad I don't have to suffer earbuds anymore with how they're always too big for my small ears!",

These headphones met that criteria and they are built well for a 7-year old to handle.  The sound is excellent, even while sitting on a noisy plane, so no complaints there.  However, I don't really like how far the part that goes over your head sticks out on the sides, and the comfort and lightness are not quite up there with the Bose I've tried, but then again neither is the price.",

I have to agree with many of the reviewers who have given these earphones low marks for comfort -- the sound is great, but it just doesn't make up for the fact that the ear pads are very hard and they really aren't large enough to cover the ear.  Very uncomfortable to use for more than about 30 minutes or so.  I am very disappointed, especially after reading the many GOOD reviews.  These people must have really small, really hard heads.",

Turns out that for me, at least, there is no comparison.  There's nothing wrong with the Sennheisers, but their claimed 32 DB (passive) noise reduction is not anywhere as good in practice as the AT. When I listen in my noisy apartment, with the typical airco and refrigerator and washer\/dryer running, I hear a lot of rumble with the Sennheisers but the AT tunes it all out.",

After a couple of days of running pink noise and sine waves through them, the bass is really starting to deepen an expand.  These things are a really fantastic deal!",

I can't stand ear buds. After reading many reviews, and comparing them to others, I chose these, and I'm very happy with them. The sound is crisp, and there's not too much bass. They're very comfortable. For $100 you can't beat them.",

They do not color the sound like other headphones so they can be used as monitors for recording purposes. They are comfortable and fit securely while sealing out exterior noise.  Parts are replaceable which is a huge option that I have not seen offered by other brands.  These are not throw away headphones.  They are keepers!",

They cancel enough noise to use in the field and are built like a tank. They are also ideal for editing because of their flat response giving you the most accurate mix for monitoring. Unlike other \"over-ear\" headphones these actually cover the whole ear, making it comfortable to use for hours. My friend who gave them to me as a birthday present swears by them and has had his own pair for 7 years.", "My search continues.... I've been looking far and wide for headphones that can tolerate some of the higher frequencies of classical music, but to no avail. This Sennheiser however does carry fantastic bass and overall sound. They sound fantastic for games, and movie sound effects.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCompared to my audio technicas m50s, these are more comfortable to wear, and seal out unwanted noise.", "The sound is good and works really well on the airplane (which is .... The sound is good and works really well on the airplane (which is what I bought them for). However they are very uncomfortable and hurt my head. The top squishes down on my head and they squish my ears. I have a pretty small head. Kind of annoyed because I'll probably have to buy another pair eventually that aren't painful to wear.", "Sounds good depending what you plug it in to. Sounds good depending what you plug it in to. My ears sweat on 2 to 3 hr flight uncomfortable to wear. Have to turn up device very loud to appreciate sound quality. May have to look at beats.", "Fantastic. I can only rave about these cans.  I got them after seeing them reviewed over at Gizmodo as the best budget headphones, and I can't agree more.  They're comfortable to wear for long periods of time, they're light, yet rugged, and they sound fantastic.  After a couple of days of running pink noise and sine waves through them, the bass is really starting to deepen an expand.  These things are a really fantastic deal!", "Comfortable to wear. These things hurt my ears, MUSICALLY!!! Comfortable to wear, but the audio sounded like it was coming out of a tin can. Awful sound reproduction. I returned these and bought the Audio Technica ATH M50X. I compared the Sennheiser HD 280 and Audio Technicas to the same MP3 player. A Zune MP3 player and a professional Wheatstone broadcast audio mixer.  I did not touch any EQ settings. The Audio Technica ATH M50's sounded so nice and smooth. The technical specs for both headphones are not consistent and not complete. Impedance mismatch??? Not sure.", "SENNHEISER HD-280 PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONES. The surround ear headphones are very comfortable to wear. The pads are firm enoungh to reduce most outside noise. I use this product for viewing HD, Std DVD and Cable broadcasts. The sound quality for highs tones are not high enough me. The mid and low tones frequencies are much better than expected.", "I'm no audiophile, but these are great. I'm no expert on headphones. But I've used these for listening to music, watching movies, playing electric piano, etc. The range and quality are great. For the price, you can hardly complain. I've found them very comfortable, but after a long period of time, they do seem to be tight fitting (especially if I'm wearing glasses, when they press the frames against my temples).", "The fit is very tight, and clamps hard on the ears.. I received one of these with some packaging issues, and returned it--Amazon's great for that, of course, but I do have to echo the comments of others here. I tried these on. They sound fine, but fit very poorly. I have a hard time imagining men--or women with hair, as it were--feeling comfortable wearing these. The fit is very tight, and clamps hard on the ears. Maybe they loosen up over time, but this is a fixable issue, and Sennheiser should get on it.", "Uncomfortable. I needed closed-ear headphones for noise isolation (working in a lab) and also good sound. These model has both. The ambient noise was reduced significantly (equipment noise, people talking). The sound was very good, noticeably better than my cheaper HD-515. Other nice things are a coiled cord, decent materials and design.\r\r\r\nHowever these headphones are very uncomfortable because of the pressure on the head. Plus I wear glasses so be aware that this may be a factor. I tried them in different positions for a couple of hours, then finally gave up with a huge headache. Will be returning, unfortunately."]
